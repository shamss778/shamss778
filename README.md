### Projects
**[Occlusion Resilient Human Pose Estimation](https://github.com/shamss778/OR_Pose_Implementation)**  
This is an ongoing projoct, still implementing and comparing models for occlusion-robust pose estimation using Mean Teacher, ResNet101, and regularization with human pose priors.  
Focused on unsupervised domain adaptation and visibilityâ€‘guided curriculum learning. 

**[MRI Brain Image Generation](https://github.com/shamss778/Brain-MRI-Synthesis)**  
Designed a Deep Convolutional GAN for synthetic MRI brain data generation.  
Optimized generatorâ€“discriminator structure for stable training and realistic medical image synthesis.

**[Deep Learning Face Detection Model at MODERERING]()**                                                                                   
Built and trained a deep learning face detection model achieving 0.02 crossâ€‘entropy loss and <4% mean absolute error, fineâ€‘tuned on the MRCD dataset to handle face variation, with experiments deployed on AWS SageMaker.
